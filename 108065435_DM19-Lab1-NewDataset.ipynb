    "I applied two kinds of Naive Bayes Classifiers: the Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier on the TF IDF Features and the Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier on the Word Frequency Features. Here are the observed differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bernoulli Naive Bayes is useful for when features can only have 2 values (0 or 1). In the example here we can take Sentiment Score as the feature, as it is only 1 (Positive) or 0 (Negative). On the other hand, Multinomial Naive Bayes is more useful when dealing with vectors that represent frequencies (hence the use of the word frequency features for this model).\n",
    "2. Multinomial Naive Bayes has a slightly highly accuracy score than the Bernoulli Naive Bayes. Its score is .0058224163 higher.\n",
    "3. Looking at the confusion matrix of the 2, we can see that the Multinomial classifier had more accurate predictions (534 true positives and true negatives total) vs Bernoulli (530). However, the Bernoulli classifier was able to generate more true negative predictions while the Multinomial classifier was able to generate more true positive predictions. On the other hand, the Bernoulli classifier had more false negatives while the Multinomial classifier had more false positives.\n",

    "In the lab, we applied each step really quickly just to illustrate how to work with your dataset. There are somethings that are not ideal or the most efficient/meaningful. Each dataset can be handled differently as well. What are those inefficent parts you noticed? How can you improve the Data preprocessing for these specific datasets?"

    "1. Category and Category Name Columns are Redundant, as they both refer to the same thing but in different ways. We can just choose one of these columns for less redundancy.\n",
    "2. We need to clean the data set early on (e.g. remove stopwords) so we can perform more relevant analysis later. During the first few parts of preprocessing we didn't really do proper cleaning of the unigrams, hence a really large matrix with sparse values.\n",
    "3. In the Attribute Transformation section, the for loop that does the loading term frequencies takes long to load. We can perform further cleaning to remove and aggregate some irrelevant words, or pick a smaller sample size.\n",
    "4. Some charts, such as the bar chart of 300 terms, is visually hard to understand (e.g. too many bars to help provide insight, too small). We can pick a better way to visualize by choosing a better type of visualization (e.g. scatter plot or heatmap if we are using lots of features) or reduce the sample size.\n",

    "<b> SENTIMENT LABELLED SENTENCES </b>\n",
    "1. After checking for duplicates, even if duplicates were detected, I chose not to eliminate duplicates as I found this was not ideal for this dataset. This is because of the nature of the data - it is plausible that similarly worded reviews are given by different people, and removing duplicates in this case might actually compromise the integrity of the data.\n",
    "2. Only basic text cleaning was done here (lowercasing, removing symbols, lemmatizing, removing stop words). For more quality data, we can do more advanced preprocessing such as Part of Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition, and Coreference Resolution."
